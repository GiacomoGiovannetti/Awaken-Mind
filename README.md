## :floppy_disk: About the project

This is a project realized for [Start2Impact's](https://www.start2impact.it/) -React- module of the Full Stack Web Developer course. For this project i had to build a Web app to practice meditation, the app had to include some features such as :

- A timer programmable by the user
- The timer could be stopped or resumed
- References about meditation
- Intuitive UX/UI

The project had also to include some specific technologies like:

- React Router
- React Hooks
- Context API / Redux
